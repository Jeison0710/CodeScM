This program takes a file with Bspline coeficients and generates a file with the wave function evaluate in a regular grid.

This regular grid is constructed by dividing the space in intervals (xmax-xmin)/nb where nb is the number of Bsplines, 
then it can be further divided by nquad making a equidistance grid of nb*nquad points separated by (xmax-xmin)/(nb*nquad) .

The output file name is 009999inputfilename.

In the input file put the name of the file, order of bsplines, number of Bsplines, xmax,xmin and nquad to use

to compile the code just type
 make test
 
to run the code use
 make run
